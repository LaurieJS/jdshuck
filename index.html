            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>My name is Jayson Shuck, and I recently accepted the position of
                Senior Manager with the IT department located at the Redwood
                City office. I am excited to have this opportunity to work with
                Electronic Arts, and I look forward to meeting with each and every
                one of you.</p>

            <p>I come to EA with ten years of technical management experience
                spanning a number of different technologies in the entertainment,
                communication, government and managed/hosted services space.
                The last four years, I have been leading technical operations groups,
                as a hands on manager, supporting front-line production services,
                software development, testing efforts along with company and
                organizational improvements.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
        <p>On a personal front, I have a number of interests such as classic British sports car restoration and
            Karaoke. However, as of late, I've been enjoying exploring the Bay Area on my Can-Am RTS
            (Canadian motorcycle) which I call the machine.</p>
